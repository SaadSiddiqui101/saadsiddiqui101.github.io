      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Introduction</h4>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">During the tough times of the pandemic, one of the main challenges was
        to identify COVID-19 affected areas. Such information was vital for the medical staff to determine and stop the
        chain transmission of the virus and reach concerned people immediately for COVID testing. The same information
        was also helpful for the general audience to avoid close contact with people who have COVID-19.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">
        To research the given scenario, we looked at one of the applications developed by the government of Pakistan and
        identified possible opportunities and gaps.</p>

      <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Research</h4>
      
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4"><strong>"COVID-19 Gov PK"</strong>, developed by the government of Pakistan, a portal containing COVID-related
        information. It provides city-wise affected count and the nearest labs and test centers.</p>

      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">The Gap</h4>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">The availability of localized information</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">While the summarized version helps, sometimes localized data such as
        statistics on nearby locations is crucial for the users traveling in an emergency. According to our research,
        several users took the warnings seriously when informed of the nearby situations. It also helped them make
        better decisions.</p>

      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">The validity and authentication of such information</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">In some instances, users have reported the data as misleading and false.
        There is no method to authenticate the validity of the information making it more challenging due to widespread
        false news.</p>

      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">The time of such information</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">The app failed to provide real-time updates. Many users reported that the
        data was never updated in various locations as well. One of the reasons for the delay in updating the
        information is the lack of proper infrastructure to manage data and having no checks on the actual active cases
        in hospitals.</p>


      <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Design Opportunity (HMW)</h4>
      <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl font-semibold italic my-10">How can we help people get authenticated information
        rapidly regarding COVID-affected areas of Pakistan?</p>

        <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Proposed Solution</h4>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">Contact Tracing is one of the most effective methods to reduce the spread of
          the virus. According to the available information on CDC’s website, contact tracing starts when a suspected
          patient is tested positive for the virus. </p>

          
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">We can use this process to mark all the possible locations where the COVID patient might have gone before coming to the hospital. A ballpark figure is then synthesized and re-checked with the available data to obtain the correct amount of people affected in a specific area. </p>

          <p class="text-lg font-semibold md:mt-14">A Peer-to-peer network</p>
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">To tackle the infrastructure issue and provide the most updated
            information, we decided to make the application decentralized. We relied heavily upon the authenticated
            hospitals’ data to compare the statistics along with the frequency at which the network received data to
            manage the authenticity of the statistics.</p>

          <p class="text-lg font-semibold md:mt-14">Authentication of medical staff</p>
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">Authentication of medical staff is a crucial step in our data validation
            process. We use the data from the hospitals to compare the incoming reports and manage the authenticity. The
            authentication process requires an admin who manages the accounts so that only authenticated personnel can
            validate the information.</p>

          <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">One of the gaps found while researching existing applications is the
            availability of local data. We decided to provide this information as heat maps inspired by Snapchat. By
            providing localized information, users will be able to take caution when traveling to affected locations.

      <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Future Considerations</h4>
      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Design Optimization</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">We identified design optimization as one of the crucial steps to improving the authenticity of the information. By leveraging the new ideas in blockchain technology, we can improve applications' performance and enhance the network created.</p>

        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Multi-device application</p>
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4 pb-14">To increase the overall usability and provide users ease in accessing the application. We decided to deliver this information on multiple platforms with similar experiences across each device.</p>
