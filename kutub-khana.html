      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Introduction</h4>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">There are more than 2824 products currently being exported to 194
        countries, and 4039 products are being imported from 208 countries, making import and export a massive ecosystem
        that includes traders, banks, and 73 federal ministries that regulate the import and export.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">
        Pakistan Single Window is an enterprise that set out to build a system that would improve the efficiency of
        Pakistanâ€™s Trade System and digitize various government and federal ministries. It will comply with the Single
        Window standards of other countries and provide a single gateway for trade-related activities.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">
        As a User Experience Engineer my goal was to design a modular system to help the team ideate and develop most of
        PSW's functions with ease and efficiency. </p>



      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Why did we need a modular design system?</h4>

      <div class="mt-14 xl:flex     justify-center">
        <span class="inline-block mr-4">
          <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Consistency</h4>
          <p class="xl:max-w-40ch md:text-lg font-light">For documenting our design decisions so we could reflect on them and
            try to
            remove inconsistencies.</p>
        </span>
        <span class="inline-block xl:mx-4 mt-7 xl:mt-0">
          <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Scalability</h4>
          <p class="xl:max-w-40ch md:text-lg font-light">For quick expansion without requiring lots of effort. Our team could
            use
            pre-existing patterns to build, test, and deploy functionality.</p>
        </span>
        <span class="inline-block xl:ml-4 mt-7 xl:mt-0">
          <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Efficiency</h4>
          <p class="xl:max-w-40ch md:text-lg font-light">For brainstorming and building, the process becomes much more
            efficient when
            there are predefined patterns than can be used by the team.</p>
        </span>
      </div>
      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">How did we start our journey?</h4>
      <span class="inline-block    mt-10">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Mapping the architecture</h4>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Initially, we created an information architecture to map out the main functions.
          This
          activity gave us an insight into the scale and user flows.</p>
        <img class="rounded-xl mt-10" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img1.jpg" />

      </span>

        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Working with Requirement Artifacts</h4>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">After analyzing requirement artifacts like business requirements, and requirement
          traceability matrices, we improved the user flow, ensuring they align with the business and product goals.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="inline-block    mt-10">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Auditing Component Library and Removing Inconsistencies</h4>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">After understanding the scale, functions, and user flows, we audited the existing
          component library and fixed any inconsistent design decisions.</p>
      </span>

      <p class="text-2xl font-light my-24">At the end of identification and research phase, we identified following
        goals</p>
    
   
      <span class="p-7 block rounded-xl" style="background-color:#232323">
        <p class="font-bold">To provide a consistent experience across all modules and all platforms.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">Since Pakistan Single Window (PSW) Portal supports multiple platforms and encompasses various functionalities, it was crucial to understand the need for a consistent experience.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="p-7 mt-7 block rounded-xl" style="background-color:#232323">
        <p class="font-bold">To make the experience adaptable to data</p>
        <p class="mt-2">One of the challenges identified was adapting the experience to changes 
          in data. This meant considering better empty states in the absence of 
          data, but resizable and easily navigable components when there is lots 
          of data.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="p-7 mt-7 block rounded-xl" style="background-color:#232323">
        <p class="font-bold">To reduce the learning curve of the traders new to the digital platform</p>
        <p class="mt-2">Our target audience consisted of people who have been doing import and 
          export related activities manually. This meant that they were not 
          well-versed with using a digital system as a replacement. Reducing the 
          learning curve and making it easier for users to understand and perform 
          actions was also a challenge.</p>
      </span>
    
    
    
      <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-24">The Design</h4>
      <p class="text-lg mt-7">Below are some of the primary UI patterns designed to help the team achieve the goal.</p>

      
      <div class="mt-7 pb-7 widget flex flex-wrap md:flex-nowrap">



        <ol class="widget-list" id="colors">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">The design system contains two main colors in its palette, Lapis Lazuli
            (#3E5277) and Green (#009A5E). The palette exists, keeping accessibility in mind. (The shades are easily
            distinguishable even in the case of color blindness).</p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img2.png" />
        </ol>

        <ol class="widget-list" id="type">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Two fonts have been introduced as part of the design system. These two fonts are
            Proxima Nova & Montreal. The font pairing provides a good weight variation while keeping the overall visual
            style consistent. </p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img3.png" />
        </ol>

        <ol class="widget-list" id="layouts">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Predefined layouts are designed focusing on the data. These layouts help in
            quickly arranging large chunks of data on the screen.</p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img4.png" />
        </ol>

        <ol class="widget-list" id="forms">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Form submission is one of the most frequent actions in the application. These
            forms are the exact conversion of the paper-based forms with data items required to be filled by the
            traders. Some of the major parts of the form pattern includes hierarchy of actions through visual separation
            and sub-forms.</p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img5.png" />
        </ol>

        <ol class="widget-list" id="grids">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">We ensured that the grids displaying the huge amount of data were easily navigable by introducing various sub-functions like search, sort, collapse, lock etc.</p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img6.png" />
        </ol>

        <ul class="widget-tabs flex flex-row md:flex-col order-first items-baseline">
