      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Introduction</h4>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">To provide structural education, many universities in Pakistan make
        buying course
        books necessary. There are many formats in which these books are available, offering a thorough knowledge of a
        subject and also helping teachers in planning. They are available in stores, libraries, and various digital hubs
        at different costs.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">
        Acquiring these books presents itself with a few problems which discourage students. To empathize and understand
        these problems and come up with a solution for them, I conducted interview sessions and documented the whole
        design process.</p>



      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Phase 1 - Research</h4>
      <span class="inline-block    mt-10">

        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Everyone remembers buying books in their first year, but most of these books
          were now kept in their cupboards with no further use after their semester.
          A general statement we received while trying to dive deep into this problem was</p>
        <p class="md:text-lg mt-3">"There is no need to buy a hard copy of the course material because there are PDFs
          available."</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">After doing a survey I found out that not everyone was inclined towards this
          idea and to be precise, out of 30 respondents during the interview, we found that 27 of the respondents
          have referred to the written course books once or more than one time.</p>
        <img class="rounded-xl mt-10" src="./src/resources/images/prj2img2.png" />
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-10">Furthermore, I also found out that the majority of people who were either using the books every day or some days were mostly freshmen and sophomore students. </p>
        <p class="md:text-lg mt-3">"Most of the students in the third and fourth year of their bachelor's program told us that the books they bought in the first year were still with them and that those books were of no use to them and they felt that they wasted their money."</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">Most of the students in the third and fourth year of their bachelor's program told us that the books they bought in the first year were still with them and that those books were of no use to them and they felt that they wasted their money.</p>
      </span>
      

      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Phase 2 - Converting insights into actions</h4>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-10">At the end of research phase, we organized our findings using affinity diagram</p>
      <img class="rounded-xl mt-10" src="./src/resources/images/prj2img3.jpg" />
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">We highlighted the following problems that were common in many of the interviews.</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">a. Unavailability of books</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">b. Cost of books</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">c. Quality of books</p>

      <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-24">The Design</h4>
      <p class="text-lg mt-7">Below are some of the primary UI patterns included in our design system, identified as
        being used repeatedly and required by the majority of our team members.</p>


      <div class="mt-7 pb-7 widget flex flex-wrap md:flex-nowrap">



        <ol class="widget-list" id="colors">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">The design system contains two main colors in its palette, Lapis Lazuli
            (#3E5277) and Green (#009A5E). The palette exists, keeping accessibility in mind. (The shades are easily
            distinguishable even in the case of color blindness).</p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img2.png" />
        </ol>

        <ol class="widget-list" id="type">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Two fonts have been introduced as part of the design system. These two fonts
            are
            Proxima Nova & Montreal. The font pairing provides a good weight variation while keeping the overall visual
            style consistent. </p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img3.png" />
        </ol>

        <ol class="widget-list" id="layouts">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Predefined layouts are designed focusing on the data. These layouts help in
            quickly arranging large chunks of data on the screen.</p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img4.png" />
        </ol>

        <ol class="widget-list" id="forms">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Form submission is one of the most frequent actions in the application. These
            forms are the exact conversion of the paper-based forms with data items required to be filled by the
            traders. Some of the major parts of the form pattern includes hierarchy of actions through visual separation
            and sub-forms.</p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img5.png" />
        </ol>

        <ol class="widget-list" id="grids">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">We ensured that the grids displaying the huge amount of data were easily
            navigable by introducing various sub-functions like search, sort, collapse, lock etc.</p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img6.png" />
        </ol>
