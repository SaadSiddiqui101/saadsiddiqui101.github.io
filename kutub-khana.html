      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Introduction</h4>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">Course books play a crucial role in universities where students use these books to gain in-depth knowledge of a subject and prepare for their exams. There are many formats in which these books are available such as soft copies like PDFs, ebooks available online, and hard copies available in stores and libraries at different costs.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">
        Acquiring these books presents itself with a few problems which discourage students. To empathize and understand
        these problems and come up with a solution for them, I conducted interview sessions and decided to come up with
        a solution following a three-phase design thinking framework.</p>



      <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Phase 1 - Research</h4>
      <span class="inline-block    mt-10">

        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">To start, I approached university students for qualitative interviews and
          surveys. The first thing was to inquire about the need for hard copies since students have other options like
          eBooks and PDFs.</p>


        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">A survey showed that out of 30 respondents, 27 of them have referred to
          the printed course books once or more during their studies. Furthermore, I also found out that majority of the
          people using the books were freshmen and sophomore students, and most of these books were used for only a
          small duration and specific courses.</p>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl my-8  font-semibold italic">"I would choose books because it is much easier to
          focus. I use books for math-related subjects such as Linear Algebra. It is much easier to read equations in
          printed format than on a screen."</p>
        <img class="rounded-xl mt-10" src="./src/resources/images/prj2img2.png" />
        <p class="font-light text-sm text-center mt-2 ">Survey Results: Usage of course books.</p>


        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Key Takeaways (Design Opportunities)</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg ">Two major challenges were identified when the students were interviewed about
          acquiring books from stores and libraries.</p>

        <span class="p-7 mt-7 block rounded-xl" style="background-color: #232323;">
          <p class="text-xl mt-14">Challenge 1: The Unavailability of books</p>
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">During interviews, we found out that most students were struggling to
            obtain course material when needed. The other option for the students was to issue the book from the library
            but they faced the same issue there as well.</p>
          <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl my-8  font-semibold italic">"Most of the books are not available in the stores
            nearby, and you have to go far to buy them."</p>
        </span>

        <!-- ------- ******** ------- -->
        <span class="p-7 mt-7 block rounded-xl" style="background-color: #232323;">
          <p class="text-xl  mt-14">Challenge 2: The Feeling of being wasteful with money</p>
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">Upon further inquiry, most of the students in the third and fourth year
            of their bachelor's program told us that the books they bought in the first year were still with them and
            that those books were of no use to them and they felt that they wasted their money.</p>
          <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl  font-semibold italic my-8">"Many of the course books are expensive. Also, why
            should we buy books when they are only going to be used for one semester and then kept away."</p>
        </span>
        <!-- ------- ******** ------- -->

        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Outcome of Research</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Our interviews with students gave us lots of insights which were organized
          using an affinity diagram below.</p>

      <h4 class="   mt-32 text-xl font-bold">Phase 2 - Converting insights into actions</h4>

      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10">Creating User Personas</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3 mb-10">Qualitative User personas were created based on the students we
        interviewed. These personas represent a group of qualities that proved to be the foundation for our ideation and
        design phase.</p>

      </div>


      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Brainstorming and Ideation</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Afterward, I held brainstorming sessions and general interviews with the students
        to gain their insights on what they thought an optimal solution could be. These ideas were then grouped and an
        optimal solution was selected that would cater to most if not all the problems we have identified.</p>
