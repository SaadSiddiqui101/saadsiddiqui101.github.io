            Course books play a crucial role in universities where students use these books to gain in-depth knowledge
            of a subject and prepare for their exams. There are many formats in which these books are available such as
            soft copies like PDFs, ebooks available online, and hard copies available in stores and libraries at
            different costs.</p>
          <p class="     mt-4 ">
            <span> Acquiring these books presents itself with a few problems which discourage students. To empathize and
              understand
              these problems and come up with a solution for them, I conducted interview sessions and decided to come up
              with
              a solution following a three-phase design thinking framework.</span>

            the printed course books once or more during their studies. Furthermore, majority of the
            people using the books were freshmen and sophomore students, and most of these books were used for only a
            small duration and specific courses.</p>

          <p class="">Upon further inquiry, most of the students in the third and fourth year
