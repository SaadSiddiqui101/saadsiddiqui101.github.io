      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Introduction</h4>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">Course books play a crucial role in universities where students use these books to gain in-depth knowledge of a subject and prepare for their exams. There are many formats in which these books are available such as soft copies like PDFs, ebooks available online, and hard copies available in stores and libraries at different costs.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">
        Acquiring these books presents itself with a few problems which discourage students. To empathize and understand
        these problems and come up with a solution for them, I conducted interview sessions and decided to come up with
        a solution following a three-phase design thinking framework.</p>

      <h4 class="   mt-24 text-3xl font-bold">Phase 1 - Inspiration</h4>
      <span class="inline-block    mt-10">

        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3"><strong style='color:orange;'>A survey we conducted showed that out of 30 respondents, 27 of them have referred to
          the printed course books once or more during their studies.</strong> Furthermore, majority of the
          people using the books were freshmen and sophomore students, and most of these books were used for only a
          small duration and specific courses.</p>
        <p class="text-lg my-8  font-semibold italic">"I would choose books because it is much easier to
          focus. I use books for math-related subjects such as Linear Algebra. It is much easier to read equations in
          printed format than on a screen."</p>
        <img alt="Survey Results: Usage of course books." class="rounded-xl mt-10" src="./src/resources/images/prj2img2.webp" />

        <p class="font-light text-sm text-center mt-2 ">Survey Results: Usage of course books.</p>
       
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-8">I approached a group of university students for <strong style="color:orange;"> qualitative interviews. </strong> Our interviews with students gave us lots of insights which we organized
          using an <strong style='color:orange;'>affinity diagram</strong> below.</p>

       
        <img alt="Affinity Diagram" class="rounded-xl mt-10" src="./src/resources/images/prj2img3.webp" />
        <p class="font-light text-sm text-center mt-2 ">Organization of problems identified during interviews</p>

      

        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Key Takeaways (Design Opportunities)</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg ">Two major challenges were identified when the students were interviewed about
          acquiring books from stores and libraries.</p>

        <span class="p-7 mt-7 block rounded-xl" style="background-color: #232323">
          <p style="color:orange;" class="text-xl mt-14">Challenge 1: The Unavailability of books</p>
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">During interviews, we found out that most students were struggling to
            obtain course material when needed. The other option for the students was to issue the book from the library
            but they faced the same issue there as well.</p>
          <p class="text-lg my-8  font-semibold italic">"Most of the books are not available in the stores
            nearby, and you have to go far to buy them."</p>
        </span>

        <!-- ------- ******** ------- -->
        <span class="p-7 mt-7 block rounded-xl" style="background-color: #232323;">
          <p style="color:orange;" class="text-xl  mt-14">Challenge 2: The Feeling of being wasteful with money</p>
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">Upon further inquiry, most of the students in the third and fourth year
            of their bachelor's program told us that the books they bought in the first year were still with them and
            that those books were of no use to them and they felt that they wasted their money.</p>
          <p class="text-lg   font-semibold italic my-8">"Many of the course books are expensive. Also, why
            should we buy books when they are only going to be used for one semester and then kept away."</p>

      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3 mb-10"><strong style='color:orange;'>Qualitative User personas</strong> were created based on the students we
        interviewed. These personas represent a group of qualities that proved to be the foundation for our ideation and
        design phase.</p>

      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Brainstorming and Ideation</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">Afterward, I held <strong style='color:orange;'>brainstorming sessions</strong> and <strong style='color:orange;'>general interviews</strong> with the students
        to gain their insights on what they thought an optimal solution could be. These ideas were then grouped and an
        optimal solution was selected that would cater to most if not all the problems we have identified.</p>
      <img alt="Brainstorming 1" class="rounded-xl mt-10" src="./src/resources/images/prj2img4.webp" />
      <p class="font-light text-sm text-center mt-2 ">Organization: We used post-its to organize and group different ideas.</p>

      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">To measure the overall experience and to verify our solution, we approached our users for moderated testing. Our test included cases like <strong style='color:orange;'>success rate, completition time, time taken at each section</strong> etc.</p>

      <p class="font-light text-sm text-center mt-2 ">Success for indivisual task</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">The measured success for each task adds up to 75% success rate considering each of the 4 tasks were tested with 10 different users with different level of digital literacy and prior experience with online stores.</p>

      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">
        While many tasks were completed in 4 seconds or less, there was confusion observed while users were performing task 3 and task 4 hence resulting in more time taken to complete.</p>
