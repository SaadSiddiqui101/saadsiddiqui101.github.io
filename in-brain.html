      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Introduction</h4>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">Children with Down Syndrome are commonly known for the genetic disorder
        that is due to the existence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. These children suffer from both medical and
        physical impairment, however, the degree of impairment may vary for each child.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">As a <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>design researcher</strong>, my goal was to highlight issues and limitations of eductional tools for children with down syndrome and drive out user needs by providing a hypothetical solution. </p>

      <h4 class="   mt-24 text-3xl font-bold">Research</h4>
      <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Understanding the System</h4>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">We used a<strong style='color:#FF8479;'> qualitative research method</strong> to understand the needs of children with Down Syndrome. Therefore, we developed a 19 questions questionnaire, proofread by the research supervisor for authentication, and then taken to the Karachi Down Syndrome Program (KDSP), where we conducted interviews.</p>
        <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">Following are some key takeaways from the interviews</p>
      <span class="inline-block    mt-10">
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold ">Medical Issues</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">Medical problems associated with Down syndrome can vary widely from child to
          child. While <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>some kids and teens need a lot of medical attention</strong>, others lead healthy lives. Students with
          Down syndrome may: need to go to the school nurse for
          medications when necessary, miss class time due to frequent doctor visits.</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Additional Assistance</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">The respondents also reported that children with Down Syndrome <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>need visual and
          auditory accommodations for classroom instruction</strong>, require physical, occupational, and speech therapies, need
          extra time and assistance with classwork and require therapeutic staff support in the classroom.</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Parents' Involvement</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">According to our research at KDSP, many teacher showed concerns for the <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>lack
          of parents' involvement in the learning process of their child.</strong> They stated that if parents were more involved alongside teachers, learning could be much faster. </p>


        <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Conducting a Market Research</h4>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">In order to understand the current landscape of eductional tools for the children, we also conducted a market research.</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">A tool called <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>MathDS Math Down Syndrome</strong> was developed in two different languages, Malay, and English, to favor children with Down Syndrome. It has three different features: Learning, Activities, and Practice. Through this application, children can learn at their own pace.
          <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>WAVE</strong> is another free tool available that provides evaluators with the accessibility of web pages (WEBAIM, 2001). It is an application that provides resources to users like courses and course material. Students with disabilities can learn these courses at their own pace easily.</p>
          <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">Following are some key points highlighted while researching various tools </p>

          <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Accessibility</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">While there is a wide variety of tools available, most of them are hard to find, and they are not easily accessible by parents. Some of them were only available for special schools and the cost to access them was very high.</p>
        
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Validity</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">Some tools used proper research and validation from various Psychologists to build and improve, while others gave no proof of validation, making parents hesitant to use them.</p>
       
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Connectivity</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">While many tools performed well, they still had no means for parents to measure their child's performance nor had any facility to export any reports generated.</p>

      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10">User Persona</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3 mb-10">To understand our users better, we divided them into two groups to focus on their individual needs. Below I've highlighted the <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>major characteristics of both of our user groups</strong>.</p>

      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">System Overview</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">To get a big picture of all the functionalities of our internal system, we created a <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>system diagram</strong>.</p>

      <p class="font-light text-sm text-center mt-2 ">Organization: High-level system diagram</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-14">We also laid out a complete workflow for our <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>external system (API)</strong> that will be used to develop various educational tools and sync with our internal system.</p>
      <img alt="API Workflow" class="rounded-xl mt-10" src="./src/resources/images/prj3img3.webp" />

      <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Platform Demo</h4>
      <p  class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10">Intuitive children's interface partnered with an analytical app for parents</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3 mb-10">To make the interface simple, the first design decision we took was to separate the two major functionalities. Technically this also helped us reduce the size of each application and allowed parents to download the analytical app only in case they are only exploring.
        Switching between applications was designed with ease and security in mind therefore we used encrypted codes to connect both applications.</p>

      <p class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-14">Conclusion</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4 ">According to the research question at the beginning of this study, we have found that currently there is <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>a gap in the discoverability of educational tools for children with Down Syndrome</strong> and the <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>unavailability of one coherent application to assist parents</strong> in taking part in their child's educational needs.
       </p>
   
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4 pb-10">

        Our solution to the researched problem was catering to all the important key factors such as accessibility of the platform, the connectivity between doctors and parents, limitations of other tools in the market, etc.</p>
