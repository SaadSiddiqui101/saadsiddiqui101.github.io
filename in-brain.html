      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Introduction</h4>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">Children with Down Syndrome are commonly known for the genetic disorder
        that is due to the existence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. These children suffer from both medical and
        physical impairment, however, the degree of impairment may vary for each child.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">As a design researcher, my goal was to identify the problems related to
        educational tools for children with down syndrome and figure out ways to solve them.</p>



      <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Identifying Problems in Current System</h4>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg">The process used a qualitative research method. Therefore, we developed a 19
        questions questionnaire, proofread by the research supervisor for authentication, and then taken to the Karachi
        Down Syndrome Program (KDSP), where we conducted interviews.</p>
      <span class="inline-block    mt-10">
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold ">Medical Issues</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Medical problems associated with Down syndrome can vary widely from child to
          child. While some kids and teens need a lot of medical attention, others lead healthy lives. Students with
          Down syndrome may: need to go to the school nurse for
          medications when necessary, miss class time due to frequent doctor visits.</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Additional Assistance</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">The respondents also reported that children with Down Syndrome need visual and
          auditory accommodations for classroom instruction, require physical, occupational, and speech therapies, need
          extra time and assistance with classwork and require therapeutic staff support in the classroom.</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Parents' Involvement</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg ">According to our research at KDSP, many teacher showed concerns for the lack
          of parents' involvement in the learning process of their child. </p>


        <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Conducting a Market Research</h4>

        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Key Takeaways (Design Opportunities)</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg ">Two major challenges were identified when the students were interviewed about
          acquiring books from stores and libraries.</p>

        <span class="p-7 mt-7 block rounded-xl" style="background-color: #232323;">
          <p class="text-xl mt-14">Challenge 1: The Unavailability of books</p>
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">During interviews, we found out that most students were struggling to
            obtain course material when needed. The other option for the students was to issue the book from the library
            but they faced the same issue there as well.</p>
          <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl my-8  font-semibold italic">"Most of the books are not available in the stores
            nearby, and you have to go far to buy them."</p>
        </span>

        <!-- ------- ******** ------- -->
        <span class="p-7 mt-7 block rounded-xl" style="background-color: #232323;">
          <p class="text-xl  mt-14">Challenge 2: The Feeling of being wasteful with money</p>
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">Upon further inquiry, most of the students in the third and fourth year
            of their bachelor's program told us that the books they bought in the first year were still with them and
            that those books were of no use to them and they felt that they wasted their money.</p>
          <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl  font-semibold italic my-8">"Many of the course books are expensive. Also, why
            should we buy books when they are only going to be used for one semester and then kept away."</p>
        </span>
        <!-- ------- ******** ------- -->

        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Outcome of Research</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Our interviews with students gave us lots of insights which were organized
          using an affinity diagram below.</p>
        <img class="rounded-xl mt-10" src="./src/resources/images/prj2img3.jpg" />

      </span>


      <h4 class="   mt-32 text-xl font-bold">Phase 2 - Converting insights into actions</h4>

      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10">Creating User Personas</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3 mb-10">Qualitative User personas were created based on the students we
        interviewed. These personas represent a group of qualities that proved to be the foundation for our ideation and
        design phase.</p>

      <div class="rounded-xl bg-image-slideshow p-14">
        <div class="flex items-center justify-center">
          <div class="w3-left text-2xl mr-4" onclick="plusDivs(-1)">&#10094;</div>

          <span class="w3-badge demo border ml-2 rounded-3xl inline-block" onclick="currentDiv(3)"></span>
        </div>
      </div>


      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Brainstorming and Ideation</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Afterward, I held brainstorming sessions and general interviews with the students
        to gain their insights on what they thought an optimal solution could be. These ideas were then grouped and an
        optimal solution was selected that would cater to most if not all the problems we have identified.</p>
