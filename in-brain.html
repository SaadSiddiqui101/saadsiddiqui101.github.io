      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Introduction</h4>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">Children with Down Syndrome are commonly known for the genetic disorder
        that is due to the existence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. These children suffer from both medical and
        physical impairment, however, the degree of impairment may vary for each child.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">As a design researcher, my goal was to highlight issues and limitations of eductional tools for children with down syndrome and drive out user needs by providing a hypothetical solution. </p>



      <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Identifying Problems in Current System</h4>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg">The process used a qualitative research method. Therefore, we developed a 19
        questions questionnaire, proofread by the research supervisor for authentication, and then taken to the Karachi
        Down Syndrome Program (KDSP), where we conducted interviews.</p>
        <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">Following are some key takeaways from the interviews</p>
      <span class="inline-block    mt-10">
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold ">Medical Issues</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Medical problems associated with Down syndrome can vary widely from child to
          child. While some kids and teens need a lot of medical attention, others lead healthy lives. Students with
          Down syndrome may: need to go to the school nurse for
          medications when necessary, miss class time due to frequent doctor visits.</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Additional Assistance</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">The respondents also reported that children with Down Syndrome need visual and
          auditory accommodations for classroom instruction, require physical, occupational, and speech therapies, need
          extra time and assistance with classwork and require therapeutic staff support in the classroom.</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Parents' Involvement</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg ">According to our research at KDSP, many teacher showed concerns for the lack
          of parents' involvement in the learning process of their child. They stated that if parents were more involved alongside teachers, learning could be much faster. </p>


        <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Conducting a Market Research</h4>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg ">In order to understand the current landscape of eductional tools for the children, we also conducted a market research.</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">A tool called MathDS Math Down Syndrome was developed in two different languages, Malay, and English, to favor children with Down Syndrome. It has three different features: Learning, Activities, and Practice. Through this application, children can learn at their own pace.
          WAVE is another free tool available that provides evaluators with the accessibility of web pages (WEBAIM, 2001). It is an application that provides resources to users like courses and course material. Students with disabilities can learn these courses at their own pace easily.</p>

        <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl font-semibold italic my-10">How can we build an easy-to-use intuitive online learning platform to help children with down syndrome?</p>

      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10">User Persona</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3 mb-10">To understand our users better, we divided them into two groups to focus on their individual needs. Below I've highlighted the major characteristics of both of our user groups.</p>

      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">System Overview</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg">To get a big picture of all the functionalities of our system, we created a system diagram.</p>
