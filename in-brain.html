      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">Children with Down Syndrome are commonly known for the genetic disorder
        that is due to the existence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. These children suffer from both medical and
        physical impairment, however, the degree of impairment may vary for each child.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">As a <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>design researcher</strong>, my goal
        was to highlight issues and limitations of eductional tools for children with down syndrome and drive out user
        needs by providing a hypothetical solution. </p>

      <h4 class="   mt-24 text-3xl font-bold">Research</h4>
      <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Understanding the System</h4>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">We used a<strong style='color:#FF8479;'> qualitative research
          method</strong> to understand the needs of children with Down Syndrome. Therefore, we developed a 19 questions
        questionnaire, proofread by the research supervisor for authentication, and then taken to the Karachi Down
        Syndrome Program (KDSP), where we conducted interviews.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">Following are some key takeaways from the interviews</p>
      <span class="inline-block    mt-10">
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold ">Medical Issues</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">Medical problems associated with Down syndrome can vary widely from child
          to
          child. While <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>some kids and teens need a lot of medical attention</strong>,
          others lead healthy lives. Students with
          Down syndrome may: need to go to the school nurse for
          medications when necessary, miss class time due to frequent doctor visits.</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Additional Assistance</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">The respondents also reported that children with Down Syndrome <strong
            style='color:#FF8479;'>need visual and
            auditory accommodations for classroom instruction</strong>, require physical, occupational, and speech
          therapies, need
          extra time and assistance with classwork and require therapeutic staff support in the classroom.</p>
        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Parents' Involvement</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">According to our research at KDSP, many teacher showed concerns for the
          <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>lack
            of parents' involvement in the learning process of their child.</strong> They stated that if parents were
          more involved alongside teachers, learning could be much faster.
        </p>


        <h4 class="   mt-24 text-xl font-bold">Conducting a Market Research</h4>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">In order to understand the current landscape of eductional tools for the
          children, we also conducted a market research.</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">A tool called <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>MathDS Math Down
            Syndrome</strong> was developed in two different languages, Malay, and English, to favor children with Down
          Syndrome. It has three different features: Learning, Activities, and Practice. Through this application,
          children can learn at their own pace.
          <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>WAVE</strong> is another free tool available that provides evaluators with the
          accessibility of web pages (WEBAIM, 2001). It is an application that provides resources to users like courses
          and course material. Students with disabilities can learn these courses at their own pace easily.
        </p>
        <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">Following are some key points highlighted while researching various
          tools </p>

        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Accessibility</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">While there is a wide variety of tools available, most of them are hard to
          find, and they are not easily accessible by parents. Some of them were only available for special schools and
          the cost to access them was very high.</p>

        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Validity</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">Some tools used proper research and validation from various Psychologists
          to build and improve, while others gave no proof of validation, making parents hesitant to use them.</p>

        <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-14">Connectivity</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">While many tools performed well, they still had no means for parents to
          measure their child's performance nor had any facility to export any reports generated.</p>

      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10">Paper Prototyping</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3 mb-10">We used <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>paper prototypes</strong> as a
        quick way to validate our understanding of user needs show experimenting with the key stakeholders of the
        project. This activity gave us a starting direction for initial designs.</p>

      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4">To get a big picture of all the functionalities of our internal system, we

        and sync with our internal system.</p>

      <p class="text-lg font-semibold mt-10">Intuitive children's interface partnered with an analytical app for parents
      </p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3 mb-10">To make the interface simple, the first design decision we took was to
        separate the two major functionalities. Technically this also helped us reduce the size of each application and
        allowed parents to download the analytical app only in case they are only exploring.
        Switching between applications was designed with ease and security in mind therefore we used encrypted codes to
        connect both applications.</p>

            1. More than 70% (avg) prefered new designs due to <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>easier access to

            2. It was observed that people preference for <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>quantity of data on a screen
              had a direct relation with their digital literacy.</strong> <br><br>
            3. Eye tracking results directed our design decisions to organize information and actions in much better
            way.

      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-4 ">According to the research question at the beginning of this study, we have
        found that currently there is <strong style='color:#FF8479;'>a gap in the discoverability of educational tools

        Our solution to the researched problem was catering to all the important key factors such as accessibility of
