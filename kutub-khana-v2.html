      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Introduction</h4>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">To provide structural education, many universities in Pakistan make
        buying course
        books necessary. There are many formats in which these books are available, offering a thorough knowledge of a
        subject and also helping teachers in planning. They are available in stores, libraries, and various digital hubs
        at different costs.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">
        Acquiring these books presents itself with a few problems which discourage students. To empathize and understand
        these problems and come up with a solution for them, I conducted interview sessions and decided to come up with
        a solution following a three-phase design thinking framework.</p>



      <h4 class="   mt-32 text-xl font-bold">Phase 1 - Research</h4>
      <span class="inline-block    mt-32">

        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">To start our journey, I got in touch with university students for qualitative interviews and surveys. The first thing was to inquire about the need for hard-copies of books since students have other options like eBooks and PDFs etc.</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-10">During one of the interview, a statement I recieved was </p>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl my-8  font-semibold italic">"There is no need to buy a hard copy of the course material
          because there are PDFs
          available."</p>
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">But a survey afterwards showed that not everyone was inclined towards
            this
            idea and to be precise, out of 30 respondents, 27 of the them
            have referred to the written course books once or more than one time during their studies. Furthermore, I also found out that the majority of people who were 
            using the books were mostly freshmen and sophomore students and most of these books were used for only a small duration and for certain courses.</p>
            <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl my-8  font-semibold italic">"I would choose books because it is much easier to focus. I use books for math related subjects such as Linear Algebra. It is much easier to read equations in printed format rather than on a screen."</p>
          <img class="rounded-xl mt-10" src="./src/resources/images/prj2img2.png" /> 
          <p class="font-light text-sm text-center mt-2 ">Survey Results: Usage of course books.</p>

        
          <p class="text-2xl mt-32">Key Takeaways (Design Opportunities)</p>
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">Two major challenges identified in this scenario were</p>

        <p class="text-2xl font-light mt-14">Challenge 1: The Unavailability of books</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">During interviews we found out that most students were struggling to obtain course material when needed. The other option for the students was to issue the book from the library but they faced the same issue there as well. </p>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl my-8  font-semibold italic">"Most of the books are not available in the stores nearby, and you have to go far in order to buy them."</p>
      
      
        <!-- ------- ******** ------- -->
   
        <p class="text-2xl font-light mt-14">Challenge 2: The Feeling of being wasteful with money</p>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">Upon further inquiry, most of the students in third and fourth year of their bachelors program told us that the books they bought in the first year were still with them and that those books were of no use to them and they felt that they wasted their money.</p>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-2xl  font-semibold italic my-8">"Many of the course books are expensive. Also why should we buy books when they are only going to be used for one semester and then kept away."</p>
       
         <!-- ------- ******** ------- -->
        
         <p class="text-2xl mt-32">Outcome of Research</p>
         <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">Our interviews with students gave us lots of insights which were organzied using an affinity diagram below.</p>

      <h4 class="   mt-32 text-xl font-bold">Phase 2 - Converting insights into actions</h4>
  
      <p class="text-2xl  mt-32">Creating User Personas</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3 mb-10">Qualitative User personas were created based on the students we interviewed. These personas represents a group of qualties which proved to be the foundation for our ideation and design phase.</p>

      <p class="text-2xl mt-32">Brainstorming and Ideation</p>
      <p class="font-light md:text-lg mt-3">Afterwards, I held brainstorming sessions and general interviews with the
        students to gain their insights on what they think an optimal solution could be? These ideas were then grouped together and an optimal solution was selected that would cater to most if not all the problems we have identified.</p>
