      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Introduction</h4>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">There are more than 2824 products currently being exported to 194
        countries, and 4039 products are being imported from 208 countries, making import and export a massive ecosystem
        that includes traders, banks, and 73 federal ministries that regulate the import and export.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">
        Pakistan Single Window is an enterprise that set out to build a system that would improve the efficiency of
        Pakistanâ€™s Trade System and digitize various government and federal ministries. It will comply with the Single
        Window standards of other countries and provide a single gateway for trade-related activities.</p>
      <p class="    mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">
        As a User Experience Engineer my goal was to design a modular system to help the team ideate and develop most of
        PSW's functions with ease and efficiency. </p>



      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">Why did we need a modular design system?</h4>

      <span class="p-7 block rounded-xl mt-4" style="background-color:#232323">
        <p class="font-bold">To provide a consistent experience across all modules and all platforms.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">Since Pakistan Single Window (PSW) Portal supports multiple platforms and encompasses various functionalities, it was crucial to understand the need for a consistent experience.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="p-7 mt-7 block rounded-xl" style="background-color:#232323">
        <p class="font-bold">To increase reusability while having room for customizations</p>
        <p class="mt-2">While increasing reusability helps reduce the production time of a module, we also needed to make sure that customizations at all levels should be allowed in the system.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="p-7 mt-7 block rounded-xl" style="background-color:#232323">
        <p class="font-bold">To reduce the time it takes for the team to ideate on newer modules</p>
        <p class="mt-2">Using the design system as a tool for quick ideation became our priority goal to reduce the time to bring out new ideas, reduce design from scratch for each instance and solve the problems quicker.</p>
      </span>

      <h4 class="   mt-14 text-xl font-bold">How did we start our journey?</h4>
      <span class="inline-block    mt-10">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Mapping the architecture</h4>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Initially, we created an information architecture to map out the main functions.
          This
          activity gave us an insight into the scale and user flows.</p>
        <img class="rounded-xl mt-10" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img1.jpg" />
        <p class="font-light text-sm text-center mt-2">A structural overview of PSW's main functions</p>
      </span>
      <span class="inline-block    mt-10">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Working with Requirement Artifacts</h4>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">After analyzing requirement artifacts like business requirements, and requirement
          traceability matrices, we improved the user flow, ensuring they align with the business and product goals.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="inline-block    mt-10">
        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold">Auditing Component Library</h4>
        <p class="font-light md:text-lg">After understanding the scale, functions, and user flows, we audited the existing component library and mapped out the component's usage in various modules.</p>
        <img class="rounded-xl mt-10" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img7.png" />
      </span>
      
    
    
    
      <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-24">The Design</h4>
      <p class="text-lg mt-7">Using the concepts of the atomic design system, we started managing smaller pattern libraries while building several templates and pages. </p>
      
      <div class="mt-7 pb-7 widget flex flex-wrap md:flex-nowrap">



        <ol class="widget-list" id="atoms">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">The building blocks of our system include various input and action components along with our core color scheme and type properties. All the "atoms" of our design system have their properties.</p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img2.png" />
        </ol>

        <ol class="widget-list" id="molecules">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">Combining these atoms gives us context-free molecules containing a new set of "properties" and "states".</p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img3.png" />
        </ol>

        <ol class="widget-list" id="organisms">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">More complex higher-level components were created by joining various molecules or atoms together. Through organisms, we then provide context so they can provide one or more than one functionalities.</p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img4.png" />
        </ol>

        <ol class="widget-list" id="templates">
          <p class="font-light md:text-lg">The complex organisms are then used to create contextual templates with meaning, such as a form template shown below.</p>
          <img class="mt-4 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img5.png" />
        </ol>

          <li class="widget-tab inline-block text-left mr-4">
            <a href="#atoms" class="widget-tab-link">Atoms</a>

        </ul>
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-24">The Impact</h4>
      <p class="mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">A clear difference in time was observed between modules developed using our new design system and modules developed and designed from scratch.  </p>
      <img class="my-8 rounded-xl" src="./src/resources/images/prj1img8.png" />
      <p class="mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">While measuring the impact of our newly introduced design system, we also observed a correlation between the level of system item used (e.g. atoms, molecules, etc.), the time it took to ideate on a module, and the amount of customization allowed. </p>
      <p class="mt-4 md:text-lg font-light">This gave our team a way to be able to not only estimate and plan project timelines better but also be able to control the time and complexity relationship of each module.</p>
